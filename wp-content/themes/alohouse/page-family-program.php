     <p>The family unit can represent one of the most powerful tools for healing and recovery. For that reason- parents, significant others, and chosen family members are welcomed and invited to become a part of our treatment program. Family members and loved ones represent support, connection, and identity formation. In families where addiction is present, pain, fear, and suffering come to dominate relationships. That is why it can be so difficult, and even traumatic, to live in the chaos stemming from addiction.</p>

        <p>In order to survive the chaos, families are often forced to develop a unique language of dysfunction, where what is being said often doesnâ€™t match up with what is felt. Participation in treatment can be transformative by uncovering and healing past and present wounds, improving communication, while setting healthy and loving boundaries so that all family members can thrive. Communication styles become direct, and unhealthy patterns are replaced with clear, effective communication, assuring treatment leads to a deep and sustainable life of recovery.</p>
